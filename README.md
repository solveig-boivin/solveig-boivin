## Hi there 👋

<!--**solveig-boivin/solveig-boivin** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.-->

My name is Solveig and I'm a UX/UI designer.

🎨 I love to create and imagine new mobile app designs (hoping one day, I'll be able to code them 🚀) <br /><br />
📚 I'm currently learning accessibility best practices, mobile app development and Kotlin <br /><br />
🔭 I’m looking to collaborate on open-source projects <br /><br />
💬 Ask me about design, UX/UI, and accessibility standards <br /><br />
